        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/profile pic.jpg" alt="profile pic">
        <p>Originally a South Dakota-native, I moved to Portland 5 years ago after completing a 
                BS in English. I've worked for Lions VisionGift, a non-profit dedicated to restoring sight 
                through corneal transplants and research, since March of 2015. 
        <br><br>A year and a half ago I became the supervisor of our referral center. This position has 
            not only taught me important lessons in how to work with people effectively, it has also 
            exposed me to software project management which is a field I plan on transitioning into. 
            I'm excited to be a part of the University of Oregon's Coding Boot Camp and look forward 
            to the opportunity to meet other like-minded people who are also looking for a change.
